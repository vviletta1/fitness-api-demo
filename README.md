# 🏋️‍♀️ Fitness API Demo (Beginner-Friendly)

This Python script demonstrates how a business can use a public API to fetch and display real-time cardio exercise data. Built with customer onboarding and support training in mind, it simulates how fitness platforms (like Mindbody or ClassPass) could help clients or staff understand available offerings.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Connects to [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises) using an API key
- Fetches a list of cardio exercises and displays basic info (name, description, equipment)
- Shows how APIs can be used in a customer-facing SaaS environment

## 💡 Real-World Use Case

This script can be used as a lightweight training/demo tool to:
- Help support agents explain how fitness data is retrieved
- Teach junior team members API basics
- Assist small business clients in understanding digital product capabilities

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct folder
cd ~/Downloads/fitness

# Run the script
python fitness.py
